## Simple project that takes influxDB Data and loads it into a Grafana Dashboard. 

![Dashboard](https://github.com/anshuljethani/DevOps-Project/blob/main/dashboard_git.png)

### This gives us 5 insights on the graph : 
#### 1. Response Time
#### 2. SQL Time
#### 3. Git Time
#### 4. View Time
#### 5. Method Call Counts
#### And some extra insights

##### This was just a mini-project to learn how to connect influxDB with Grafana and understand the use case of time series databases (TSDB).
